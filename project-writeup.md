## Abstract
The goal of this project was to use classification models to determine the cause of negative reviews on an ecommerce website.

## Design
This project

## Data
The dataset contains 100,000 rows with informa

## Algorithms

*Feature Engineering*
* Converted review score into binary negative/positive target class. (Reviews with a score of 3 were removed for simplicity)
* Multiplied length, width, and height features to measure volume

*Models*
I tested K-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, and decision trees

*Model Evaluation and Selection*
The dataset was split into 

**Final random forest 5-fold CV scores:** 99 features (7 numeric) with class weights
   - Accuracy 
   - F1 
   - precision 
   - recall 

**Holdout** 
   - Accuracy:  
   - F1:  
   - Precision:   
   - Recall: 

## Tools
- Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for modeling
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting
